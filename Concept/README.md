# Concept

I came up with this idea this morning, as it supplements idle games really well. I am going to duplicate my working explanation, as it was good, and I was told it was "something that could earn me money" although I am not going to charge for this software library, ever.

## May 21st 2021

General concept: in most idle video games, there is an option called `prestige` which resets your progress, but gives you tools and resources to get back up to where you were originally and beyond faster.

The concept for this library is that it gives you a quick preview of what gameplay will be like after prestiging, without actually doing it. This way, the developer doesn't have to come up with a dialog message that describes everything that is kept and everything that is lost, as currently, no idle games cover everything in this category.

## Known problems

It may be hard to come up with a universal standard agreement between Idle Game makers on how the preview should work. I don't want it to get abused and for people to lose trust in previews, as a developer may make a fake preview in a badly developed game. There should be some verification that it is an actual official preview, and not a trick to get you to rage quit from starting over unexpectedly.
